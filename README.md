# Blackix v0.1

Blackix is a modified version of the renown [Numix](https://numixproject.org/store/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=52) theme. Features:

- All black everything; what was once #2d2d2d in Numix is now #000000.
- Highlights and links are now gray instead of light red.
- Window decoration won't turn red on scroll-over or click.
  - close == red
  - expand == green
  - hide == yellow

This theme is currently incomplete; the GTK 3.0 and Unity versions are unfinished.
